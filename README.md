# GBA-Jampack-v1
This is 3 modern games running on the old original Game Boy Advance!
I have been able to display hundreds of 3D textured polygons with animation running at a smooth frame rate on a conole not meant for 3D graphics. 
I created everything from scratch including assets and the game engine. The 3DSage game engine. 
Follow me on YouTube-3DSage and let me know what games you want to see made for volume 2, any programming tutorials, or what game you want to see further developed into a playable game. Thank you!
